# Blog App — Personal Fork

This repository is a personal working fork of the original project.

Purpose:

* Use as a reusable base for tasks, experiments, and small projects
* Modify freely without affecting upstream
* Keep a stable starting point I understand

## How I Use This Repo

I clone this repo whenever I need a ready‑to‑go application skeleton instead of rebuilding the same setup repeatedly.

```
git clone https://github.com/DevOpsByNavin/Blog-App.git
```

Then I customize per project as needed.

## Repo Structure

```bash
./
├── infra
│   └── database
├── README.md
└── services
    ├── backend1
    ├── backend2
    └── frontend
```

> Explore each directory’s `README.md` for details about individual components.

## Attribution

This project is based on the original [Blog-App repository](https://github.com/Jenkins-Organization-824/Blog-App).

All credit for the initial implementation and core structure belongs to the original authors. This fork only adapts and maintains a personal working version for reuse and experimentation.
